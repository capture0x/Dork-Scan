Dork scanning, also known as Google Dorking, involves using advanced search queries to discover sensitive or vulnerable information exposed on the internet. These queries, known as "dorks," are crafted to pinpoint specific information on search engines like Google.

This scan utilizes custom dorks, such as "php?id=", to search for potential vulnerabilities in web applications, focusing on URLs that include this specific parameter. The aim is to identify instances where websites might have exposed sensitive information, misconfigured servers, or potential entry points for security breaches.

By searching through search engine results pages, this scan aims to gather URLs that contain the specified parameter, allowing for further investigation and potential mitigation of security risks.

Note: Use this tool responsibly and ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards. Do not exploit vulnerabilities; rather, aim to assist in securing online platforms.
